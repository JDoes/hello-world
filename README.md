# hello-world
this is the hello-world repository, from GitHub Guides
I am learning how to use GitHub. This is pretty cool! This is the branch that I made, while following the Guide.
Right now, this is just me getting started with using GitHub. One day, I will not be a noob, and maybe this will be funny to me.
